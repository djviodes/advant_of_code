# Advent Of Code Solutions

Behold, my meticulously crafted [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzle solutions.

All the problems were resolved using [Rust version 1.71.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/07/13/Rust-1.71.0.html).

The aim is to master the Rust programming language while enjoying a fun and engaging learning experience.

## Puzzle input data

The input data for the challenges are sourced from the Advent of Code website and conveniently stored in separate 'input.txt' files. These files are then read and processed to obtain the necessary data for each specific task.
